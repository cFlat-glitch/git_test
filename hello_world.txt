This is part of exercise for the Foundation section of Odin Project, the lesson is Git basics.

In summary,

git remote is for managing remotes (set of repositories)
git status checks the file status (modified, staged or committed)
git add stages a modified file to the staging area to be part of next commit snapshot.
git commit -m <file> will push an update into the .git repository.
