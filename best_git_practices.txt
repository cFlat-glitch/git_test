Use Atomic Commits
Make one commit for each new feature.

Why Atomic Commits?
1) Revert 1 problematic change without losing previous changes.
2) Shorter commit messages.

Seven rules for good commit messages
1) Have a title/subject and body if message need to be detailed.
2) Subject < 50 characters.
3) Do begin title with capital letter.
4) Do not end title with punctuation.
5) Write in imperative mood as if giving instructions or demands.
6) Body < 72 characters.
7) Main focus is what and why something changed. Waste no words explaining how, that's what code's for.
